#### Example

```yaml
steps:

    uses: paambaati/codeclimate-action@v2.4.0
    env:
      CC_TEST_REPORTER_ID: <code_climate_reporter_id>
    with:
      coverageCommand: npm run coverage
      debug: true
```

#### Example with Jacoco

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Test & publish code coverage
    uses: paambaati/codeclimate-action@v2.4.0
    env:
      # Set CC_TEST_REPORTER_ID as secret of your repo
      CC_TEST_REPORTER_ID: ${{secrets.CC_TEST_REPORTER_ID}}
      JACOCO_SOURCE_PATH: "${{github.workspace}}/src/main/java"
    with:
      # The report file must be there, otherwise Code Climate won't find it
      coverageCommand: mvn test
      coverageLocations:
        "${{github.workspace}}/target/site/jacoco/jacoco.xml:jacoco"
```
